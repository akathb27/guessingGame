# guessingGame

Hello World page!!

In my Hello World page I am telling the viewer a bit about myself, some fun facts as well as some social media sites that I regularly use.
I added the links so the user could get to know more about me than is explained in the page itself, because contrary to popular belief I am not very good at talking about myself.

I also added a few fun Prompts to welcome you to my page and a fun guessing game with some trivia questions about myself.
I wanted to try a 'while' loop so I asked the user to guess a number between 1-5. If they did not guess the correct answer an alert would come up letting them know to guess again, if they answered correctly they got an attaboy for figuring out the right answer.
